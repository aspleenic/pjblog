This is a blog where I can perhaps document a few things off the beaten path of my usual rants and raves through technology, music, robots, family, the future, and my delicate sense of humor.

Anything here is not meant to offend, but it is my opinion.  I can be swayed and I hope to keep an open mind about many things.  Until I'm old and codgery anyway.  Then all bets are off.
